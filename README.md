## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of three types of gradients in CSS: linear-gradient, radial-gradient, and conic-gradient. Each gradient is applied to different sections of the webpage to showcase its effect.

## Gradient Types

1. **Linear Gradient**: Creates a smooth transition between two or more colors along a straight line.
2. **Radial Gradient**: Creates a smooth transition between two or more colors radiating from an origin.
3. **Conic Gradient**: Creates a smooth transition between two or more colors around a center point.
